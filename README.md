# ATM Project

This project simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system. It allows users to create an account, log in, chat with an AI, and exit the system.

## Features

1. **Create Account**: Users can create a new account by providing a username and a password. The system checks if the username already exists and whether the password meets the complexity requirements (at least 8 characters, including letters and numbers).

2. **Log In**: Users can log into their account by providing their username and password. 

3. **Chat with AI**: Users can interact with an AI chatbot. This feature is still under development.

4. **Exit**: Users can exit the system. Upon exiting, the system saves all user data.

## How to Run

To run this project, you need to have Java installed on your machine. Navigate to the directory containing the `ATM.java` file in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
javac ATM.java
java ATM
```

## Future Enhancements

- Implement the AI chat feature.
- Add more user operations like deposit, withdrawal, and balance check.
- Improve the password complexity check to include special characters.
- Implement data persistence to store user data between sessions.
